# Polkadot Basic Notifications ðŸ”´ ðŸ“£

A *dead-simple*, yet *highly **effective*** notification system for Polkadot and its parachains (or,
any substrate-based chain).

![Untitled(2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5588131/158027440-a819bad8-c28a-4662-9c5a-b2f850f6ee36.png)


## Configuration

You need to provide one configuration file to the program, which specifies:

1. which accounts you want to monitor.
2. which chains you want to monitor.
3. which methods (event, transactions) you want to monitor.
4. which reporters you want to use.

These configurations can be provided either as JSON or YAML. See [Examples](./examples/) folder, or the following:

```javascript
{
	// your list of accounts. For chains that use ethereum based accounts (e.g. moonbeam),
	// just use your account's public key as hex (`0xabc..`).
	//
	// If the list is empty, then no account filter is applied. This means that all events and
	// transactions will match.
	"accounts": [
		{ "address": "<ss58_address>", "nickname": "<account_nickname>" },
	],
	// a list of ws-endpoint to which we start to listen. For example, Polkadot's is "wss://rpc.
	// polkadot.io". The cool thing here is that ANY substrate-based chain will work, so you can add
	// accounts from parachains (Acala, Statemine), solo-chains (Aleph-zero), or even ethereum-based
	// chains like moonbeam.
	"endpoints": [
		"wss://rpc.polkadot.io",
		"wss://statemine-rpc.polkadot.io",
		"wss://acala-polkadot.api.onfinality.io/public-ws",
		"wss://wss.api.moonbeam.network",
		"wss://ws.azero.dev"
	],
	// a case-sensitive list of methods that you want to subscribe to to. A 'method' is either the
	// name of a transaction (usually lower_snake_case) or an event name (usually lowerCamelCase).
	// Correct values are: 'all', or { 'ignore': .. }, or { 'only': .. }. 'Ignore' implies
	// "everything is monitored except the given".
	"method_subscription": {
		"only": [
			{
				"pallet": "balances",
				"method": "transfer"
			},
			{
				"pallet": "electionProvierMultiPhase",
				"method": "*"
			},
			{
				"pallet": "*",
				"method": "remark"
			}
		]
	},
	// This is where you specify which reporters you want to use.
	"reporters": {
		// if provided, report all events to a matrix room.
		"matrix": {
			// the user if of some user from which you will send the message.
			"userId": "@your-username:matrix.org",
			// the access token of the aforementioned user.
			"accessToken": "..",
			// the id of the room to which you will send the message.
			"roomId": "..",
			// the serve in which your user exist.
			"server": "https://matrix.org"
		},

		// if provided, report all events to a set of email addresses.
		"email": {
			// the address from which you send the emails. It must be owned by the `transporter.auth` credentials once authenticated with `transporter.host`.
			"from": "from@polkadot-basic-notification.xyz",
			// The list of addresses that get notified.
			"to": ["from1@dot-basic-notification.xyz", "from2@dot-basic-notification.xyz"],
			// optional: if provided, your messages will be encrypted, but the formatting might not be as good.
			"gpgpubkey": "./pub.key",
			// this must be exactly the same object as used in the nodemailer library. See here for // more information: https://nodemailer.com/smtp/
			"transporter": {
				"host": "smtp.youremail.org",
				"port": 587,
				"secure": false,
				"auth": {
					"user": "...",
					"pass": "..."
				}
			}
		},

		// if provided, writes all reports to the file at the given path. The file is appended to
		"fs": {
			"path": "./out1.log"
		},

		// enabling this will print all reports to console as well.
		"console": {},
	}
}

```

## Deployment

I made this project to be as easy as possible to deploy, so that you don't need to rely on a 3rd
party service to receive notifications for your accounts. Although, in the above examples, you are
still relying on the honesty of the ws-nodes to which you connect. To take it a step further, you
can consider running your own nodes.

The easiest way to deploy this application is using `pm2`, or any other typical node-js deployment
service. There is already a template `pm2.config.js` provided, which you can use as

```
$ yarn run deploy:pm2
```

Alternatively, you can build a docker image from from this application based on the provided
`Dockerfile`. To build the image:

```
$ docker build . -t polkadot-basic-notification -f builder.Dockerfile
$ # note how the config file must be passed as an environment variable.
$ docker run -e CONF=config.json polkadot-basic-notification
```

## Under The Hood

The underlying workings of this program is as follows: We have a list of accounts which we want to
monitor, stored as ss58 string representation. The script then listens to incoming blocks of any
given chain, and does a full-text search of the account strings in the `stringified` representation
of both the transactions in the block, and entire events that are emitted at this block.

This is super simple, yet enough to detect any interaction to or from your accounts of interest.
Some covered examples are:

- Any transaction signed by your accounts is detected, successful or unsuccessful.
- Your staking rewards are detected both via the `Rewarded` and `Deposited` events.
- Any transfer to your account is detected, both since your account will be an argument of the
  `transfer` transaction, and the `Deposited` event.

Nonetheless, the list goes way beyond this. The only known shortcoming of this is the lack of
support for `pallet-indices`, which is essentially an alternative, shorter way to identify accounts.

Any of such events creates a `report`. Any block that contains a non-zero number of reports is
passed to an arbitrary number of `Reporter`s for delivery. The `Reporter`s are essentially the
transport mechanism, i.e. how you want to be notified. Current implementations are:

1. Matrix, using `matrix-js-sdk`.
2. Email, optionally supporting GPG encryption as well.
3. File system, writing to a file.
4. Console, only sensible for testing.
